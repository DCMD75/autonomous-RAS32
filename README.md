# autonomous-RAS32
## Introduction
This project is about building an autonomous robot.
No particular specifications are required, just comment the code and learn things.
However the aim is to build a robot to test different control algorithm and and positioning system.

## Some explanation on the hardware
The microcontroller is a STM32F103c8. The IDE used for development is the well known Keil software. 
Everything regarding Keil is not git set in the project.
